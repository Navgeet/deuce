;;; Commentary:

;; This is loaded into a bare Emacs to make a dumpable one.

;; If you add/remove Lisp files to be loaded here, consider the
;; following issues:

;; i) Any file loaded on any platform should appear in $lisp in src/lisp.mk.
;; Use the .el or .elc version as appropriate.

;; This ensures both that the Lisp files are compiled (if necessary)
;; before the emacs executable is dumped, and that they are passed to
;; make-docfile.  (Any that are not processed for DOC will not have
;; doc strings in the dumped Emacs.)  Because of this:

;; ii) If the file is loaded uncompiled, it should (where possible)
;; obey the doc-string conventions expected by make-docfile.

;;; Code:

;; Add subdirectories to the load-path for files that might get
;; autoloaded when bootstrapping.
