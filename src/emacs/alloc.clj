  LENGTH must be a number.  INIT matters only in whether it is t or nil."

  "Create a byte-code object with specified arguments as elements.
  The arguments should be the arglist, bytecode-string, constant vector,

  The first four arguments are required; at most six have any
  significance."

(defun memory-use-counts ()
  "Return a list of counters that measure how much consing there has been.
  Each of these counters increments for a certain kind of object.
  The counters wrap around from the largest positive integer to zero.
  Garbage collection does not decrease them.
  The elements of the value are as follows:
    (CONSES FLOATS VECTOR-CELLS SYMBOLS STRING-CHARS MISCS INTERVALS STRINGS)
  All are in units of 1 = one object consed
  except for VECTOR-CELLS and STRING-CHARS, which count the total length of
  objects consed.
  MISCS include overlays, markers, and some internal types.
  Frames, windows, buffers, and subprocesses count as vectors
    (but the contents of a buffer's text do not count here)."

  "Reclaim storage for Lisp objects no longer needed.
  Garbage collection happens automatically if you cons more than
  `gc-cons-threshold' bytes of Lisp data since previous garbage collection.
  `garbage-collect' normally returns a list with info on amount of space in use:
   ((USED-CONSES . FREE-CONSES) (USED-SYMS . FREE-SYMS)

    (USED-FLOATS . FREE-FLOATS) (USED-INTERVALS . FREE-INTERVALS)

  However, if there was overflow in pure space, `garbage-collect'
  returns nil, because real GC can't be done."

  "Make a copy of object OBJ in pure storage.
  Recursively copies contents of vectors and cons cells.
  Does not copy symbols.  Copies strings without text properties."

(defun memory-limit ()
  "Return the address of the last byte Emacs has allocated, divided by 1024.
  This may be helpful in debugging Emacs's memory usage.
  We divide the value by 1024 to make sure it fits in a Lisp integer."
