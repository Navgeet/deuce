(defun forward-line (&optional n)
  "Move N lines forward (backward if N is negative).
  Precisely, if point is on line I, move to the start of line I + N.
  If there isn't room, go as far as possible (no error).
  Returns the count of lines left to move.  If moving forward,
  that is N - number of lines moved; if backward, N + number moved.
  With positive N, a non-empty line at the end counts as one line
    successfully moved (for the return value)."

  Optional second arg KILLFLAG non-nil means kill instead (save in kill ring).
  Interactively, N is the prefix arg, and KILLFLAG is set if
  N was explicitly specified.
  This is meant for interactive use only; from Lisp, better use `delete-char'
  with a negated argument."

  Before insertion, `expand-abbrev' is executed if the inserted character does
  not have word syntax and the previous character in the buffer does.
  After insertion, the value of `auto-fill-function' is called if the
  `auto-fill-chars' table has a non-nil value for the inserted character."
