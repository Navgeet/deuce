  VARIABLE is a variable name whose value is either nil or a state vector
  that will be updated to contain all frames and buffers,
  aside from buffers whose names start with space,
  along with the buffers' read-only and modified flags.  This allows a fast
  check to see whether buffer menus might need to be recomputed.

  the current state."

  SECONDS may be a floating-point value, meaning that you can wait for a
  fraction of a second.  Optional second arg MILLISECONDS specifies an
  additional wait period, in milliseconds; this may be useful if your
  Emacs was built without floating point support.
  (Not all operating systems support waiting for a fraction of a second.)"
