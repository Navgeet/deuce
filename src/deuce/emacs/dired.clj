  There are three optional arguments:
  If FULL is non-nil, return absolute file names.  Otherwise return names

  If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.
  If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.

  Returns the longest string

  Returns nil if DIRECTORY contains no name starting with FILE."

  If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.
  If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.
   NOSORT is useful if you plan to sort the result yourself.
  ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid, see
  `file-attributes' for further documentation.
  On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',
  which see."
