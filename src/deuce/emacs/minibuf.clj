  "Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
  The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to
    DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when
    HIST is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.
  Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;
    if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.
  If fourth arg READ is non-nil, then interpret the result as a Lisp object
    and return that object:
    in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'
  Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
    the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the
    history list variable to use, or it can be a cons cell
    (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable
    to use, and HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer
    history commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that
    element of the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions
    are counted starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.
  Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value or the list of default values.
    If non-nil, it is available for history commands, and as the value
    (or the first element of the list of default values) to return
    if the user enters the empty string.  But, unless READ is non-nil,
    `read-from-minibuffer' does NOT return DEFAULT-VALUE if the user enters
    empty input!  It returns the empty string.
  Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
   the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.
  If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,
   then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties
   were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties."
