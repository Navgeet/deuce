  "If non-nil, Emacs ignores ISO-2022 escape sequences during code detection.

  When Emacs reads text, it tries to detect how the text is encoded.
  This code detection is sensitive to escape sequences.  If Emacs sees
  a valid ISO-2022 escape sequence, it assumes the text is encoded in one
  of the ISO2022 encodings, and decodes text by the corresponding coding
  system (e.g. `iso-2022-7bit').

  However, there may be a case that you want to read escape sequences in
  a file as is.  In such a case, you can set this variable to non-nil.
  Then the code detection will ignore any escape sequences, and no text is
  detected as encoded in some ISO-2022 encoding.  The result is that all
  escape sequences become visible in a buffer.

  The default value is nil, and it is strongly recommended not to change
  it.  That is because many Emacs Lisp source files that contain
  non-ASCII characters are encoded by the coding system `iso-2022-7bit'
  in Emacs's distribution, and they won't be decoded correctly on
  reading if you suppress escape sequence detection.

  The other way to read escape sequences in a file without decoding is
  to explicitly specify some coding system that doesn't use ISO-2022
  escape sequence (e.g `latin-1') on reading by C-x RET c.")
