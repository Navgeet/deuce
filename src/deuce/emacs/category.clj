(defvar word-combining-categories nil
  "List of pair (cons) of categories to determine word boundary.
  
  Emacs treats a sequence of word constituent characters as a single
  word (i.e. finds no word boundary between them) only if they belong to
  the same script.  But, exceptions are allowed in the following cases.
  
  (1) The case that characters are in different scripts is controlled
  by the variable `word-combining-categories'.
  
  Emacs finds no word boundary between characters of different scripts
  if they have categories matching some element of this list.
  
  More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1
  and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 is followed by
  C2 which has CAT2, there's no word boundary between C1 and C2.
  
  For instance, to tell that Han characters followed by Hiragana
  characters can form a single word, the element `(?C . ?H)' should be
  in this list.
  
  (2) The case that character are in the same script is controlled by
  the variable `word-separating-categories'.
  
  Emacs finds a word boundary between characters of the same script
  if they have categories matching some element of this list.
  
  More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1
  and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 but not CAT2 is
  followed by C2 which has CAT2 but not CAT1, there's a word boundary
  between C1 and C2.
  
  For instance, to tell that there's a word boundary between Hiragana
  and Katakana (both are in the same script `kana'),
  the element `(?H . ?K) should be in this list.")
