  The function takes one argument, FILENAME, a string;
  it specifies the file name (without a directory) of the DOC file.
  That file is found in `../etc' now; later, when the dumped Emacs is run,
  the same file name is found in the `doc-directory'."

  Each substring of the form \\[COMMAND] is replaced by either a
  keystroke sequence that invokes COMMAND, or \"M-x COMMAND\" if COMMAND
  is not on any keys.

  Each substring of the form \\{MAPVAR} is replaced by a summary of
  the value of MAPVAR as a keymap.  This summary is similar to the one
  produced by `describe-bindings'.  The summary ends in two newlines
  (used by the helper function `help-make-xrefs' to find the end of the
  summary).

  Each substring of the form \\<MAPVAR> specifies the use of MAPVAR
  as the keymap for future \\[COMMAND] substrings.
  \\= quotes the following character and is discarded;
  thus, \\=\\= puts \\= into the output, and \\=\\[ puts \\[ into the output.

  Return the original STRING if no substitutions are made.
  Otherwise, return a new string, without any text properties."
