(defun make-network-process (&rest args)
  "Create and return a network server or client process.
  
  In Emacs, network connections are represented by process objects, so
  input and output work as for subprocesses and `delete-process' closes
  a network connection.  However, a network process has no process id,
  it cannot be signaled, and the status codes are different from normal
  processes.
  
  Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
  arguments are defined:
  
  :name NAME -- NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary
  to make it unique.
  
  :buffer BUFFER -- BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate
  with the process.  Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless
  you specify an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
  BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
  with any buffer.
  
  :host HOST -- HOST is name of the host to connect to, or its IP
  address.  The symbol `local' specifies the local host.  If specified
  for a server process, it must be a valid name or address for the local
  host, and only clients connecting to that address will be accepted.
  
  :service SERVICE -- SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an
  integer specifying a port number to connect to.  If SERVICE is t,
  a random port number is selected for the server.  (If Emacs was
  compiled with getaddrinfo, a port number can also be specified as a
  string, e.g. \"80\", as well as an integer.  This is not portable.)
  
  :type TYPE -- TYPE is the type of connection.  The default (nil) is a
  stream type connection, `datagram' creates a datagram type connection,
  `seqpacket' creates a reliable datagram connection.
  
  :family FAMILY -- FAMILY is the address (and protocol) family for the
  service specified by HOST and SERVICE.  The default (nil) is to use
  whatever address family (IPv4 or IPv6) that is defined for the host
  and port number specified by HOST and SERVICE.  Other address families
  supported are:
    local -- for a local (i.e. UNIX) address specified by SERVICE.
    ipv4  -- use IPv4 address family only.
    ipv6  -- use IPv6 address family only.
  
  :local ADDRESS -- ADDRESS is the local address used for the connection.
  This parameter is ignored when opening a client process. When specified
  for a server process, the FAMILY, HOST and SERVICE args are ignored.
  
  :remote ADDRESS -- ADDRESS is the remote partner's address for the
  connection.  This parameter is ignored when opening a stream server
  process.  For a datagram server process, it specifies the initial
  setting of the remote datagram address.  When specified for a client
  process, the FAMILY, HOST, and SERVICE args are ignored.
  
  The format of ADDRESS depends on the address family:
  - An IPv4 address is represented as an vector of integers [A B C D P]
  corresponding to numeric IP address A.B.C.D and port number P.
  - A local address is represented as a string with the address in the
  local address space.
  - An \"unsupported family\" address is represented by a cons (F . AV)
  where F is the family number and AV is a vector containing the socket
  address data with one element per address data byte.  Do not rely on
  this format in portable code, as it may depend on implementation
  defined constants, data sizes, and data structure alignment.
  
  :coding CODING -- If CODING is a symbol, it specifies the coding
  system used for both reading and writing for this process.  If CODING
  is a cons (DECODING . ENCODING), DECODING is used for reading, and
  ENCODING is used for writing.
  
  :nowait BOOL -- If BOOL is non-nil for a stream type client process,
  return without waiting for the connection to complete; instead, the
  sentinel function will be called with second arg matching \"open\" (if
  successful) or \"failed\" when the connect completes.  Default is to use
  a blocking connect (i.e. wait) for stream type connections.
  
  :noquery BOOL -- Query the user unless BOOL is non-nil, and process is
  running when Emacs is exited.
  
  :stop BOOL -- Start process in the `stopped' state if BOOL non-nil.
  In the stopped state, a server process does not accept new
  connections, and a client process does not handle incoming traffic.
  The stopped state is cleared by `continue-process' and set by
  `stop-process'.
  
  :filter FILTER -- Install FILTER as the process filter.
  
  :filter-multibyte BOOL -- If BOOL is non-nil, strings given to the
  process filter are multibyte, otherwise they are unibyte.
  If this keyword is not specified, the strings are multibyte if
  the default value of `enable-multibyte-characters' is non-nil.
  
  :sentinel SENTINEL -- Install SENTINEL as the process sentinel.
  
  :log LOG -- Install LOG as the server process log function.  This
  function is called when the server accepts a network connection from a
  client.  The arguments are SERVER, CLIENT, and MESSAGE, where SERVER
  is the server process, CLIENT is the new process for the connection,
  and MESSAGE is a string.
  
  :plist PLIST -- Install PLIST as the new process' initial plist.
  
  :server QLEN -- if QLEN is non-nil, create a server process for the
  specified FAMILY, SERVICE, and connection type (stream or datagram).
  If QLEN is an integer, it is used as the max. length of the server's
  pending connection queue (also known as the backlog); the default
  queue length is 5.  Default is to create a client process.
  
  The following network options can be specified for this connection:
  
  :broadcast BOOL    -- Allow send and receive of datagram broadcasts.
  :dontroute BOOL    -- Only send to directly connected hosts.
  :keepalive BOOL    -- Send keep-alive messages on network stream.
  :linger BOOL or TIMEOUT -- Send queued messages before closing.
  :oobinline BOOL    -- Place out-of-band data in receive data stream.
  :priority INT      -- Set protocol defined priority for sent packets.
  :reuseaddr BOOL    -- Allow reusing a recently used local address
                        (this is allowed by default for a server process).
  :bindtodevice NAME -- bind to interface NAME.  Using this may require
                        special privileges on some systems.
  
  Consult the relevant system programmer's manual pages for more
  information on using these options.
  
  
  A server process will listen for and accept connections from clients.
  When a client connection is accepted, a new network process is created
  for the connection with the following parameters:
  
  - The client's process name is constructed by concatenating the server
  process' NAME and a client identification string.
  - If the FILTER argument is non-nil, the client process will not get a
  separate process buffer; otherwise, the client's process buffer is a newly
  created buffer named after the server process' BUFFER name or process
  NAME concatenated with the client identification string.
  - The connection type and the process filter and sentinel parameters are
  inherited from the server process' TYPE, FILTER and SENTINEL.
  - The client process' contact info is set according to the client's
  addressing information (typically an IP address and a port number).
  - The client process' plist is initialized from the server's plist.
  
  Notice that the FILTER and SENTINEL args are never used directly by
  the server process.  Also, the BUFFER argument is not used directly by
  the server process, but via the optional :log function, accepted (and
  failed) connections may be logged in the server process' buffer.
  
  The original argument list, modified with the actual connection
  information, is available via the `process-contact' function."

  In Emacs, serial port connections are represented by process objects,
  so input and output work as for subprocesses, and `delete-process'
  closes a serial port connection.  However, a serial process has no
  process id, it cannot be signaled, and the status codes are different
  from normal processes.
  
  `make-serial-process' creates a process and a buffer, on which you
  probably want to use `process-send-string'.  Try M-x serial-term for
  an interactive terminal.  See below for examples.
  
  Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
  arguments are defined:
  
  :port PORT -- (mandatory) PORT is the path or name of the serial port.
  For example, this could be \"/dev/ttyS0\" on Unix.  On Windows, this
  could be \"COM1\", or \"\\\\.\\COM10\" for ports higher than COM9 (double
  the backslashes in strings).
  
  :speed SPEED -- (mandatory) is handled by `serial-process-configure',
  which this function calls.
  
  :name NAME -- NAME is the name of the process.  If NAME is not given,
  the value of PORT is used.
  
  :buffer BUFFER -- BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate
  with the process.  Process output goes at the end of that buffer,
  unless you specify an output stream or filter function to handle the
  output.  If BUFFER is not given, the value of NAME is used.
  
  :coding CODING -- If CODING is a symbol, it specifies the coding
  system used for both reading and writing for this process.  If CODING
  is a cons (DECODING . ENCODING), DECODING is used for reading, and
  ENCODING is used for writing.
  
  :noquery BOOL -- When exiting Emacs, query the user if BOOL is nil and
  the process is running.  If BOOL is not given, query before exiting.
  
  :stop BOOL -- Start process in the `stopped' state if BOOL is non-nil.
  In the stopped state, a serial process does not accept incoming data,
  but you can send outgoing data.  The stopped state is cleared by
  `continue-process' and set by `stop-process'.
  
  :filter FILTER -- Install FILTER as the process filter.
  
  :sentinel SENTINEL -- Install SENTINEL as the process sentinel.
  
  :plist PLIST -- Install PLIST as the initial plist of the process.
  
  :bytesize
  :parity
  :stopbits
  :flowcontrol
  -- This function calls `serial-process-configure' to handle these
  arguments.
  
  The original argument list, possibly modified by later configuration,
  is available via the function `process-contact'.
  
  Examples:
  
  (make-serial-process :port \"/dev/ttyS0\" :speed 9600)
  
  (make-serial-process :port \"COM1\" :speed 115200 :stopbits 2)
  
  (make-serial-process :port \"\\\\.\\COM13\" :speed 1200 :bytesize 7 :parity 'odd)

  )

(defun serial-process-configure (&rest args)
  "Configure speed, bytesize, etc. of a serial process.
  
  Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  Attributes that
  are not given are re-initialized from the process's current
  configuration (available via the function `process-contact') or set to
  reasonable default values.  The following arguments are defined:
  
  :process PROCESS
  :name NAME
  :buffer BUFFER
  :port PORT
  -- Any of these arguments can be given to identify the process that is
  to be configured.  If none of these arguments is given, the current
  buffer's process is used.
  
  :speed SPEED -- SPEED is the speed of the serial port in bits per
  second, also called baud rate.  Any value can be given for SPEED, but
  most serial ports work only at a few defined values between 1200 and
  115200, with 9600 being the most common value.  If SPEED is nil, the
  serial port is not configured any further, i.e., all other arguments
  are ignored.  This may be useful for special serial ports such as
  Bluetooth-to-serial converters which can only be configured through AT
  commands.  A value of nil for SPEED can be used only when passed
  through `make-serial-process' or `serial-term'.
  
  :bytesize BYTESIZE -- BYTESIZE is the number of bits per byte, which
  can be 7 or 8.  If BYTESIZE is not given or nil, a value of 8 is used.
  
  :parity PARITY -- PARITY can be nil (don't use parity), the symbol
  `odd' (use odd parity), or the symbol `even' (use even parity).  If
  PARITY is not given, no parity is used.
  
  :stopbits STOPBITS -- STOPBITS is the number of stopbits used to
  terminate a byte transmission.  STOPBITS can be 1 or 2.  If STOPBITS
  is not given or nil, 1 stopbit is used.
  
  :flowcontrol FLOWCONTROL -- FLOWCONTROL determines the type of
  flowcontrol to be used, which is either nil (don't use flowcontrol),
  the symbol `hw' (use RTS/CTS hardware flowcontrol), or the symbol `sw'
  (use XON/XOFF software flowcontrol).  If FLOWCONTROL is not given, no
  flowcontrol is used.
  
  `serial-process-configure' is called by `make-serial-process' for the
  initial configuration of the serial port.
  
  Examples:
  
  (serial-process-configure :process \"/dev/ttyS0\" :speed 1200)

  at end of BUFFER, unless you specify an output stream or filter
  function to handle the output.  BUFFER may also be nil, meaning that
