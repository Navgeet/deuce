  "Alist of fonts vs the rescaling factors.
  Each element is a cons (FONT-PATTERN . RESCALE-RATIO), where
  FONT-PATTERN is a font-spec or a regular expression matching a font name, and
  RESCALE-RATIO is a floating point number to specify how much larger
  (or smaller) font we should use.  For instance, if a face requests
  a font of 10 point, we actually use a font of 10 * RESCALE-RATIO point.")

(defvar face-remapping-alist nil
  "Alist of face remappings.
  Each element is of the form:

     (FACE . REPLACEMENT),

  which causes display of the face FACE to use REPLACEMENT instead.
  REPLACEMENT is a face specification, i.e. one of the following:

    (1) a face name
    (2) a property list of attribute/value pairs, or
    (3) a list in which each element has the form of (1) or (2).

  List values for REPLACEMENT are merged to form the final face
  specification, with earlier entries taking precedence, in the same as
  as in the `face' text property.

  Face-name remapping cycles are suppressed; recursive references use
  the underlying face instead of the remapped face.  So a remapping of
  the form:

     (FACE EXTRA-FACE... FACE)

  or:

     (FACE (FACE-ATTR VAL ...) FACE)

  causes EXTRA-FACE... or (FACE-ATTR VAL ...) to be _merged_ with the
  existing definition of FACE.  Note that this isn't necessary for the
  default face, since every face inherits from the default face.

  If this variable is made buffer-local, the face remapping takes effect
  only in that buffer.  For instance, the mode my-mode could define a
  face `my-mode-default', and then in the mode setup function, do:

     (set (make-local-variable 'face-remapping-alist)
  	'((default my-mode-default)))).

  Because Emacs normally only redraws screen areas when the underlying
  buffer contents change, you may need to call `redraw-display' after
  changing this variable for it to take effect.")

   (1) different in appearance than the default face, and
   (2) `close in spirit' to what the attributes specify, if not exact.
