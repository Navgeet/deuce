  language modes such as C++.  By default, all comment sequences are of style
  a, but you can set the comment sequence style to b (on the second character
  of a comment-start, and the first character of a comment-end sequence) and/or
  c (on any of its chars) using this flag:
   b means CHAR is part of comment sequence b.
   c means CHAR is part of comment sequence c.
   n means CHAR is part of a nestable comment sequence.
