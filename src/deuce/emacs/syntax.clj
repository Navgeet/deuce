  "Parse Lisp syntax starting at FROM until TO; return status of parse at TO.
  Parsing stops at TO or when certain criteria are met;
   point is set to where parsing stops.
  If fifth arg OLDSTATE is omitted or nil,
   parsing assumes that FROM is the beginning of a function.
  Value is a list of elements describing final state of parsing:
   0. depth in parens.
   1. character address of start of innermost containing list; nil if none.
   2. character address of start of last complete sexp terminated.
   3. non-nil if inside a string.
      (it is the character that will terminate the string,
       or t if the string should be terminated by a generic string delimiter.)
   4. nil if outside a comment, t if inside a non-nestable comment,
      else an integer (the current comment nesting).
   5. t if following a quote character.
   6. the minimum paren-depth encountered during this scan.
   7. t if in a comment of style b; symbol `syntax-table' if the comment
      should be terminated by a generic comment delimiter.
   8. character address of start of comment or string; nil if not in one.
   9. Intermediate data for continuation of parsing (subject to change).
  If third arg TARGETDEPTH is non-nil, parsing stops if the depth
  in parentheses becomes equal to TARGETDEPTH.
  Fourth arg STOPBEFORE non-nil means stop when come to
   any character that starts a sexp.
  Fifth arg OLDSTATE is a list like what this function returns.
   It is used to initialize the state of the parse.  Elements number 1, 2, 6
   and 8 are ignored.
  Sixth arg COMMENTSTOP non-nil means stop at the start of a comment.
   If it is symbol `syntax-table', stop after the start of a comment or a
   string, or after end of a comment or a string."
