;; This is a way to represent the examples from "11.9.1 Dynamic Binding"[1] in Clojure.

;; Uses binding + var-set/alter-var-root, but not sure about this approach - at least it works.
;; deuce.emacs-lisp attempts to compile setq to intern, but that's not enough, as Emacs Lisp variables are both mutable and rebindable.
