;; "8.1 Symbol Components"[1]

;; As Emacs Lisp is a Lisp-2, a symbol can be a function and a var at the same time.
;; Deuce currently cheats a bit here, and assumes all symbols resolve into deuce.emacs-lisp.globals
;; Fns have to be resolvable from the deuce.emacs ns, and this is corrected for cars after macroexpand-all.
;; This isn't the best way, but wanted to try something simpler than how shen.clj (also a Lisp-2) does it.
